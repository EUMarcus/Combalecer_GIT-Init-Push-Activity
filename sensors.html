    <h1 style="color: aliceblue; background-color: blueviolet; padding: 10px; text-align: center;">What is a sensor?</h1>
    <p style="background-color: beige;">A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The input can be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure or any number of other environmental phenomena. The output is generally a signal that is converted to a human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.

Sensors play a pivotal role in the internet of things (IoT). They make it possible to create an ecosystem for collecting and processing data about a specific environment so it can be monitored, managed and controlled more easily and efficiently. IoT sensors are used in homes, out in the field, in automobiles, on airplanes, in industrial settings and in other environments. Sensors bridge the gap between the physical world and logical world, acting as the eyes and ears for a computing infrastructure that analyzes and acts upon the data collected from the sensors.</p>

<h1 style="color: aliceblue; background-color: blueviolet; padding: 10px; text-align: center;">What are the types of sensors?</h1>
<p style="background-color: beige;">Sensors can be categorized in multiple ways. One common approach is to classify them as either active or passive. An active sensor is one that requires an external power source to be able to respond to environmental input and generate output. For example, sensors used in weather satellites often require some source of energy to provide meteorological data about the Earth's atmosphere.

A passive sensor, on the other hand, doesn't require an external power source to detect environmental input. It relies on the environment itself for its power, using sources such as light or thermal energy. A good example is the mercury-based glass thermometer. The mercury expands and contracts in response to fluctuating temperatures, causing the level to be higher or lower in the glass tube. External markings provide a human-readable gauge for viewing the temperature.

Some types of sensors, such as seismic and infrared light sensors, are available in both active and passive forms. The environment in which the sensor is deployed typically determines which type is best suited for the application.

Another way in which sensors can be classified is by whether they're analog or digital, based on the type of output the sensors produce. Analog sensors convert the environmental input into output analog signals, which are continuous and varying. Thermocouples that are used in gas hot water heaters offer a good example of analog sensors. The water heater's pilot light continuously heats the thermocouple. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple cools, sending a different analog signal that indicates the gas should be shut off.

In contrast to analog sensors, digital sensors convert the environmental input into discrete digital signals that are transmitted in a binary format (1s and 0s). Digital sensors have become quite common across all industries, replacing analog sensors in many situations. For example, digital sensors are now used to measure humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, air quality and many other types of environmental phenomena.

As with active and passive sensors, some types of sensors -- such as thermal or pressure sensors -- are available in both analog and digital forms. In this case, too, the environment in which the sensor will operate typically determines which is the best option.</p>
